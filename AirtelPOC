If working in a PROXY environment (where bastion has internet and nodes communicate through proxy):
Pre-requisites:
- URL's or github or IBM image hub links should be whitelisted from bastion
- OCP once created, should be whitelisted from Bastion and respective nodes should be added to DNS
- Necessary admin rights if using private registry
- Trident IP's should be whitelisted and verify if they are accessible from nodes & bastion. If not done, mount errors are expected especially on ZEN pods.
- SUPER USER access to be provided from NFS server to Storage VM, since it uses wrong permissions while mounting the folders. This results in errors while creating sub-directories on storage while creating DB's

Challenges during OCP installation:
- Proxys needs to be exported for HTTP. HTTPS
- Check folders and space available before installing or downloading packages

While following Assisted Installer to install OCP:
- Reboot of nodes using ISO file should happen simultaneously since while rebooting it will look for ignition files
    - if the boot order is incorrect, then there is the risk that upon reboot, the server will boot from the ISO again and not the hard disk. 
    - The fix is to reboot the servers again and ensure that that they are booting from the hard disk.

Challenges during CP4D installation:
- Trident iP's not whitelisted which created issues while bringing up ZEN pods.
- NFS server access was insufficient that avoided ZEN-METASTORE cluster to come up.
- OCP URL should be declared as NO_PROXY and should be exported along with HTTP & HTTPS
    - If not done, this will result in error while running any command as ./cpd-cli
