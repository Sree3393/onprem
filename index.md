On Premise Airgapped bare-metal OCP/CP4D/Watsonx.Ai


{: .highlight} 
In modern enterprise environments, deploying AI and data platforms on-premise within airgapped bare-metal infrastructures presents unique challenges and advantages. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and managing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D), and Watsonx.AI in an airgapped environment on bare-metal servers.

Why Airgapped Deployments?
Airgapped environments are crucial for organizations that require heightened security, regulatory compliance, and data sovereignty. By isolating the deployment from external networks, these setups prevent unauthorized access and mitigate risks associated with external threats. Industries such as banking, healthcare, government, and defense often mandate airgapped infrastructures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their data and AI workloads.

Scope of this Documentation
This guide focuses on the following key aspects:

1. Infrastructure Preparation: Setting up bare-metal hardware, network configurations, and storage.

2. OCP Deployment: Installing and configuring OpenShift in an airgapped setup.

3. CP4D Installation: Implementing IBM Cloud Pak for Data, ensuring all dependencies and services function offline.

4. Watsonx.AI Integration: Deploying and managing Watsonx.AI for AI model training and inference.

5. Best Practices: Security hardening, performance optimization, and maintenance strategies for airgapped environments.
