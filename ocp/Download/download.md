# **Downloads**  

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive list of all the essential binaries required for the **OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)** installation process. These downloads ensure that all necessary components, tools, and utilities are available for a **smooth and efficient** deployment.

## **Required Binaries and Components**  

1. **OC Mirror**  
   The **OC Mirror Plugin** is used to create a **local mirror** of OpenShift container images and operators. This is essential for **disconnected or air-gapped** environments, ensuring that the cluster can pull the required images without accessing external repositories.

2. **OpenShift (OCP)**  
   The core **OpenShift Container Platform binaries** are required for setting up and managing the cluster. These include the OpenShift installer, CLI tools (`oc` and `kubectl`), and related utilities.

3. **Operators**  
   **OpenShift Operators** provide automated management and lifecycle control for services running on OpenShift. These include both **Red Hat-certified** and **third-party operators**, which enhance the platform’s capabilities.

4. **OLM Utils Image**  
   The **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Utilities Image** contains tools necessary to manage **operator installation, upgrades, and dependencies**, ensuring seamless integration within the OpenShift ecosystem.

5. **NFS (Network File System) IMAGE**  
   **NFS utilities and configurations** are required for setting up shared storage, enabling OpenShift nodes to access persistent storage across the cluster.

6. **Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)**  
   IBM’s **Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D)** binaries are needed for deploying AI, data management, and analytics workloads within the OpenShift environment. This includes **base software components, services, and dependencies**.

7. **AI Model**  
   The AI Model package includes **pre-trained models, libraries, and dependencies** for running AI workloads on **IBM Watsonx.ai** within OpenShift. These models facilitate **machine learning and deep learning inference** at scale.

By downloading and preparing these binaries, we ensure a **seamless OpenShift installation** with all required components in place.
