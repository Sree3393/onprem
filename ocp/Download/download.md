# **Downloads**  

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive list of all the essential binaries required for the **OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)** installation process. These downloads ensure that all necessary components, tools, and utilities are available for a **smooth and efficient** deployment.

## **Required Binaries and Components**  

1. **OC Mirror**  
   The **OC Mirror Plugin** is used to create a **local mirror** of OpenShift container images and operators. This is essential for **disconnected or air-gapped** environments, ensuring that the cluster can pull the required images without accessing external repositories.

2. **OpenShift (OCP)**  
   The core **OpenShift Container Platform binaries** are required for setting up and managing the cluster. These include the OpenShift installer, CLI tools (`oc` and `kubectl`), and related utilities.

3. **Operators**  
   **OpenShift Operators** provide automated management and lifecycle control for services running on OpenShift. These include both **Red Hat-certified** and **third-party operators**, which enhance the platformâ€™s capabilities.



By downloading and preparing these binaries, we ensure a **seamless OpenShift installation** with all required components in place.
