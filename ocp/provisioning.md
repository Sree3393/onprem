# Requirements  

In this section, we focus on the **hardware, network, and software prerequisites** necessary for deploying **OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)** in an **on-premise, airgapped** environment. Ensuring these requirements are met is critical for the seamless installation, operation, and scalability of **Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) and Watsonx.ai**.  

## **Key Areas Covered:**  
- **Hardware Requirements** â€“ CPU architecture, resource sizing, and storage needs.  
- **Whitelisting** â€“ Required external URLs for container images, telemetry, and updates.  
- **Network Communication** â€“ Internal cluster communication and port configurations.  

Properly setting up these requirements ensures **high availability, security, and optimal performance** for enterprise workloads.
