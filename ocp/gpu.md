# GPU Requirements  

To efficiently support **foundation models** in **IBM Watsonx.ai**, a **high-performance GPU** is required. These GPUs provide the necessary computational power for **AI/ML model training, inference, and deep learning workloads**.  

## **Supported GPU Models**  

IBM Watsonx.ai supports the following **NVIDIA GPUs** for optimal performance:  

| GPU Model | Memory | Purpose |
|:----------|:------:|:--------|
| **NVIDIA A100** | 80 GB | Designed for AI, ML, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. |
| **NVIDIA H100** | 80 GB | Optimized for large-scale AI workloads and transformer-based models. |
| **NVIDIA L40S** | 48 GB | Suitable for AI inference, graphics rendering, and mixed workloads. |

## **Why These GPUs?**  

- **High Memory Bandwidth** – Supports large foundation models without bottlenecks.  
- **Tensor Cores** – Enables accelerated deep learning computations.  
- **Scalability** – Designed for multi-GPU configurations to handle **distributed AI training**.  
- **Enterprise-Grade Performance** – Ensures efficiency, reliability, and lower latency in AI workloads.  

Having one of the **recommended GPUs** is **essential** for deploying **IBM Watsonx.ai** in an **on-premise, airgapped** environment, ensuring **seamless AI/ML operations** at scale.
